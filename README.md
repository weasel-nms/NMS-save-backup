# NMS Save File Backup
Backs up No Man's Sky save files and settings files to ZIP for safekeeping.

### How it works
This tool is composed of two simple parts:
1. A powershell script, which determines your save file location, and then archives them into a ZIP files named with a timestamp, in the Documents\My Games\No Man's Sky Backups folder
2. A clickable shortcut, intended to reside on your desktop, but certainly locatable anywhere you choose.

### Instructions
To "install" it, if it can be called that, just download the ZIP file and open it.  Copy the `NMSbackup.ps1` file to your Documents folder, and copy the `No Man's Sky save file backup` shortcut to your Desktop (or wherever you want to keep it.)  Double-click the shortcut to run it.
